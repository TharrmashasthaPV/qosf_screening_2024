## QOSF Screening Task 3 : Optimization

This repository contains the solution files for the QOSF Screening Task 3. 

The task involves solving the Bin Packing problem using optimization. First, the problem is posed as an Integer Linear Program (ILP), which is then converted into a QUBO. We use four different ways to solve the QUBO:

- Using Brute Force Solver
- Using DWave Annealing Simulator
- Using Variational Approach
- Using QAOA

The Jupyter notebook contains solutions obtained on solving using each of the four methods. The other *.py files contain the solver functions and other auxiliary functions used to solve the QUBO.
